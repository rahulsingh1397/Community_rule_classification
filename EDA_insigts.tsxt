ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM EDA ANALYSIS
Based on the data analysis, here are the game-changing insights that completely reshape our strategy:

Key Dataset Characteristics:
Training Data: 2,029 samples (NOT a small dev set as initially thought!)
Rules: Only 2 rules in training data
Balance: ~1,000 samples per rule (very well balanced)
Class Distribution: 50.8% violation rate (well balanced)
Test Challenge: Only 10 test samples, but likely contains unseen rules

Strategic Implications:
ðŸš€ REVISED WINNING STRATEGY
1. This is NOT Pure Few-Shot Learning
With 1,000+ samples per rule, we have sufficient data for:

Traditional supervised learning approaches
Deep learning models (BERT fine-tuning)
Robust cross-validation
Advanced ensemble methods
